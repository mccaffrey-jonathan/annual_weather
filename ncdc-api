Allows 1000 requests per diem.  With a bit of caching on your end, this sound slike plenty to get off the gorund.

The token is supposed to be passed in the header but I cannot figure out how!

GHCNDMS is monthly summaries, EMNT, EMXT, MMNT, MMXT, and MNTM may be enough to build your dat?
    > Is MNTM bounded by MMXT and MMNT?
    > Should we do 1 year or last 5 or 10?  Start with 1?

Check coverage in continental US?
How to find closest city or station?

; I see weird values here that don't look like temperatures
  {:station "GHCND:AR000875850",
   :value 191,
   :attributes "0,0",
   :datatype "MMXT",
   :date "1999-05-01"}

Group the data differently:

TODO Those data-points may not be complete for all stations,
their API doesn't seem to have a way to specify data that has ALL of a series of datasets

Sample over time?

For one location over time, histogram of included fields per-date
    For multiple sampled locations, big histogram of fields per-date?
        Doesn't capture alot of the subtleties of distribution

Over a span of time, for multiple locations sampled by population
    API: population sample US cities
    Histogram of how many months over time had all 5 datetypes present

Strangely, the STATIONS endpoint reports an error if dates are used
Datatype and set constraints are fine

Both the geocoding & ncdc apis have initial rate-limits although these can be loosened with commercial licenses.
Start at 1000 requests/day.  If you get there, you will be fine.
