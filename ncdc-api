You Almost certainly should switch to client-side geocoding !
Done !  Basically !




Allows 1000 requests per diem.  With a bit of caching on your end, this sound slike plenty to get off the gorund.

The token is supposed to be passed in the header but I cannot figure out how!
    I figured out how !

GHCNDMS is monthly summaries, EMNT, EMXT, MMNT, MMXT, and MNTM may be enough to build your dat?
    > Is MNTM bounded by MMXT and MMNT?
    > Should we do 1 year or last 5 or 10?  Start with 1?

Check coverage in continental US?
How to find closest city or station?

; I see weird values here that don't look like temperatures
  {:station "GHCND:AR000875850",
   :value 191,
   :attributes "0,0",
   :datatype "MMXT",
   :date "1999-05-01"}

Group the data differently:

TODO Those data-points may not be complete for all stations,
their API doesn't seem to have a way to specify data that has ALL of a series of datasets

Sample over time?

For one location over time, histogram of included fields per-date
    For multiple sampled locations, big histogram of fields per-date?
        Doesn't capture alot of the subtleties of distribution

Over a span of time, for multiple locations sampled by population
    API: population sample US cities
    Histogram of how many months over time had all 5 datetypes present

Strangely, the STATIONS endpoint reports an error if dates are used
Datatype and set constraints are fine

Both the geocoding & ncdc apis have initial rate-limits although these can be loosened with commercial licenses.
Start at 1000 requests/day.  If you get there, you will be fine.

TODO: use something form the average data for a station to partitition it into a color palette.  For now, temperate

# Designing display 
I think all of the backgrounds should be primarily white, so as not to waste immense amounts of ink.
Scale on the side vs on the plot ?

TODO axis labels, or labels on chart?  Convert labeling to F (or optional C?)
Month labels on bottom?
Well-designed labels about location?

    -20 to 120 is not a bad range
    I like the line axes but they are a wee bit noisy ATM, need to make less bold
    5, 10, or 20 degree F seems good
    Need to add sexy label in bottom corner... if it fits ?
    Try to fit it a few places?  Clever.

    Animate in chart onces data arrives?  Like a badass?
    Make labels noninvasive?
    Need to make axes and chart not bump heads
    Do we make chart fill to page if it's not print layout ?

Try out weekly chart ?
    GHCNDMS dataset is monthly data.
    You could probably reassemble weekly from GHCND (daily summaries)
        Not really an average temperature ?  You could use multi-day maximum for the extre bounds ?


TODO polish up LA design to be servable
    Make the LA label based off padding from the bottom right corner ?
    Hide every other line with a fancy filter + class ?
    TODO produce 15 different variants
        with different stroking, fading, etc ?
        print out the components you need and line them up ?
        Hack it up inbrowser ?
            Right now, the month labels don't match up well with the plots
            Move labels ?
            Vertical lines ?
            ! Color Alternation ! With Plots !

Get page dimensions set for serving and print CSS ?
Probe list of cities

# Design/Front-End TODO ?
!!! TODO: about link with explanation of bars and link and explanation 
of NCDC API format and your use.
! TODO fade in additional axes marks when hovering with lines ?
!! TODO hover for touchscreen devices with finger over
    Fade in tooltip or pulse to indicate an action ?
!! TODO try in half-a-dozen browser sizes to get layout happy
! TODO make label size relative to screen-size ?
! TODO Highlight months on axis with bars

Light, pastelly colors for the vertical graph ticks seems to work well
I think the months on the bottom should match the body colors ?
Make sure the middle line can show up in printing !

Try month labels abutting bars on the graph ?

What do we need to do to serve real datas ?
If we are seeing modest load, collect statistics about lookups and density for each of these layers.
    Layers for caching:
    Option
        Geocoding
            Addr string to address component/bounds thingies
        Station Lookups
            Lookup similar bounds ?
                Maybe store bounds as points located at center ?
                Look up by a small sub-rect
    Also: Geocode -> station cache ?

    station+query->weather cache
        Yearly expiration date ?

geocoding -> Addres

Click on axis for celsius?  Option in URL ?  Do it based on regions ?

BUG Hovering your mouse over the page during loading blocks visibilitu of the graph !  Weird !

TODO fancy opening of graphics from median line

TODO keywordize middleware or options for json-params ?

TODO Better logging for empty/error results from HTTP requests
